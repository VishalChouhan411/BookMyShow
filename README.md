# Almabetter-full-stack-project

there are 2 folders in the repo one is of frontend and the other is of backend handling the server

after cloning both the repo node modules are to be installed seperately for both the frontend and backend
both frontend and backend are running on the seperate ports which are 3000 and 8080 respectively

the front end contains the ui part handling the fetching and posting of the data collected on the client side further the work is handled by the server which 
into the database establishes a connection with it and gives us the response according to it which has to be displayed by the frontend.

just type npm install in the respective folders to install the node packages necessary for the app to run and youre good to go!

This project contains both frontend and the backend in real the backend is hosted on heroku cloud and the frontEnd is hosted on the aws cloud amazon.
the frontedn with the api end points communicates with the server which then goes into the database and looks out the data and is further sended as 
a response to the front end which is then updated in the ui part. This complex project has taught many aspects of the handling of the complete frontend and backend 
and has given a brief introduction to how the complete web works.Also how the erros work and we get and also to handle them. The complete mvc pattern has been used
to achieve the working of the project.

Bonus :- a delete button is added to clear the database which is a delete request on the same api url which 
will delete all the the data and clear out the database further emptying it.
