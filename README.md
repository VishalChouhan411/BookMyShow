# Hi, I'm Vishal Chouhan
I am a Full stack learner at Almabetter and this is my Second project on Play Quiz

# Bookmyshow
there are 2 folders in the repo one is of frontend and the other is of backend handling the server

after cloning both the repo node modules are to be installed seperately for both the frontend and backend
both frontend and backend are running on the seperate ports which are 3000 and 8080 respectively

the front end contains the ui part handling the fetching and posting of the data collected on the client side further the work is handled by the server which 
into the database establishes a connection with it and gives us the response according to it which has to be displayed by the frontend.

just type npm install in the respective folders to install the node packages necessary for the app to run and youre good to go!
